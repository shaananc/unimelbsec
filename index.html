He is currently studying vulnerabilities in human-AI collaboration, with applications in broad scenarios such as self-driving vehicles, medical diagnosis, fraud detection and cyberanalysis.  His focus is on building attacks aiming at AI decision-making, computing and human resources, human-machine trust, and on designing and analyzing security protocols against such threats. Zheguang was a postdoctoral researcher at Technical University at Darmstadt from 2021-2022.  He obtained PhD in computer science from Brown University in 2021." data-buttontext="Visit researcher profile" name=Stundets><img src=images/full/ZheguangZhao.jpeg alt="Zheguang Zhao"><div class=photo-caption>Zheguang Zhao</div></a></li></ul><footer></footer></div></div><script src=https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.9.1/jquery.min.js></script>
